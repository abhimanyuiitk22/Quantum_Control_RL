# Quantum Control Using Reinforcement Learning  This work was completed as part of my course project **EE798z - Mathematical Engineering and Physics Using Machine Learning**. The project focuses on generating robust states of a two-level quantum system in the presence of various types of noise using reinforcement learning (RL).
