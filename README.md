# Quantum Control Using Reinforcement Learning

This work was completed as part of my course project **EE798z - Mathematical Engineering and Physics Using Machine Learning**. The project focuses on generating robust states of a two-level quantum system in the presence of various types of noise using reinforcement learning (RL).

### Based on the Work of:
- **Model-Free Quantum Control with Reinforcement Learning**  
  *V. V. Sivak, A. Eickbusch, H. Liu, B. Royer, I. Tsioutsios, and M. H. Devoret*

- **Improving Robustness of Quantum Feedback Control with Reinforcement Learning**  
  *Manuel Guatto, Gian Antonio Susto, Francesco Ticozzi*
